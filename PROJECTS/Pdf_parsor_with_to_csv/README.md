Nsdl-Parser is a java-based project. This project takes nsdl statement pdf along with it's password(if is protected). It parses the whole pdf and fetches the data in proper format and generates csv's like crediential , mutual funds , holding among many others. I built this project during my internship period at MyDhan Company. This project is built by analyzing patterns found using regex and use them to separate and extract the data.
